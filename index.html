        <p>Hello. My name is Jack Toshio Holt and I am from Texas.
            I am a Brigham Young University of Idaho Alumni with a Bachelors in Automotive Engineering, and ASE A6 and Lean Six Sigma certification.
            Currently I am full time employee for Toyota Motor Company as a Quality Assuance Specialist with Toyota Financial Services.
            While I do find enjoyment in my position I am eager to broaden my skillset and hopefully find new career opportunities with a second Bachelors in Software Development.
            My recreational activities include going to the gym, reading, gaming, or spending my time with my wife and children.

        <h2>Texas</h2>
        <img src="images/texas.webp" alt="Alamo">
        <p>Texas is located in the southern part of the United States, where football can be considered a religion, religion can be considered a personality, and a personality can be considered hating California.
            The only thing bigger than the portions sizes in Texas is a Texans' ego, personified by the aftermarket lift kits on their Dodge RAM pickup trucks that have never touch dirt, go 60 mph in schoolzones, and tailgates you if don't do the same.</p>
