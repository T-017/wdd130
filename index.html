        <h2>Texas</h2>
        <img src="images/state.webp" alt="Texas Postcard">
        <p>Texas is located in the southern part of the United States, where football can be considered a religion, religion can be considered a personality, and a personality can be considered hating California.
            The only thing bigger than the portions sizes in Texas is a Texans' ego, personified by the aftermarket lift kits on their Dodge RAM pickup trucks that have never touch dirt, go 60 mph in schoolzones, and tailgates you if don't do the same.</p>
